# AngularFavoriteAuthors
Angular assignment for Coding Dojo.  Basic CRUD methods plus Angular routing and nested components.

Adjustments pending.

Still need to resolve conflicts between angular routes and server routes by adding an 'api/authors' route at the base of the server routes
and a catch all.
